# DeFund: Blockchain-Based Chit Fund Web App

This project is a blockchain-based chit fund web application that allows users to participate in a decentralized chit fund. A chit fund is a type of savings scheme popular in India where a group of people pool their money and take turns receiving the lump sum. In this web app, participants can join a chit fund, make monthly contributions, and receive a lump sum each month. The decentralized nature of the app means that there is no central authority controlling the chit fund, and all transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and security.

This project is intended for anyone interested in participating in a chit fund, especially those who are looking for a decentralized and secure platform to do so. It can be used by individuals or groups looking to save money, earn interest, or receive a lump sum. It can also be used by anyone interested in blockchain technology and its potential applications in finance.
